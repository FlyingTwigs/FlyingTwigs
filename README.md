### Hi there 👋

People might know me as TheFaR8 or TheFaR previously, as I just changed my username recently.

I'm a year 4 Computer Science at The Chinese University of Hong Kong and I'm passionate in building open-source applications (and definitely learning something new along the way). 
You can contact me through my [Email](mailto:theodorefabianr@gmail.com), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thefar8) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theodorefabian/)

🔭 I’m currently taking courses for on Final Year Project (Computer Vision related topic), Cloud Computing and Algorithm
